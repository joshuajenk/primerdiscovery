A command-line tool for designing, evaluating, and visualizing PCR primers in both singleplex and multiplex assays. It combines Primer3, thermodynamic QC, BLAST specificity checks (with local fallback), and rich outputâ€”ASCII maps, color-coded metrics, and optional graphical plots and Excel exports.
To Clone Repository for Python use...
    git clone https://github.com/joshuajenk/primerdiscovery.git
    cd primerdiscovery
    Install Repositories --> pip install pandas primer3-py biopython matplotlib thefuzz openpyxl
    Run Tool --> python main.py

To Run Tool...
s --> singleplex reaction, five optimal pairs for one qPCR/RT-PCR
m --> multiplex reaction, five optimal multiplex panels for up to 10+ pathogens.
templates --> templates can be added to the 'data' folder -- currently filled with 30+ blood-borne pathogens
custom --> add custom nucleic acid sequence, 100 to 1000 bp
ncbi --> ncbi accession codes can be found on NCBI PubMed per each gene... NOTE: entire gene will be searched, not specific targets
